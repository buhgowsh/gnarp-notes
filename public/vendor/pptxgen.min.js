 Placeholder for the PptxGenJS library (v3.12.0).
 In a real project, this file would contain the full minified source code of the library.
 Serving this file locally is the key to fixing the issue where ad-blockers prevent
 the script from loading from a CDN, which was causing the PowerPoint download to fail.
